            <p>I thought that this module was interesting in terms that it helped me learn more about how a game should work and what makes it fun. This module helped to look at games and history through a different perspective by using the HPS framework. Overall, I would say that this module will be useful for my Unessay.&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Reflection </h1>
            <h2><p>I feel that I must express that for most of this interlude period, I was unable to attend class and thus might have missed some key discussions that could have strengthened my reflection. In any case, I do feel that I have a good understanding of what was taught during this period.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In <span style="color: rgb(44,130,201);"><em>Agency as Art </em>by C. Thi Nguyen</span> I really enjoyed the argument about how the aesthetic of a game influences the gamers experince. As someone who is easily attracted to something because of the visual aspects, I can say that I agree with this argument. If I were playing a game that was not visually or aesthetically pleasing, I do not think that I would continue to play that game.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even then, I feel that there is always room for improvement or development in any game. Just like the reading by <span style="color: rgb(44,130,201);">T. Mills Kelly <em>"But Mine's Better": Teaching History in a Remix Culture </em></span>there are moments in teaching where you can think about new ways to teach. I remember taking a history class back in high school and the way that my teacher would prep the class for tests would be through a game called "Pitching for Points". I clearly remember how he divided the class into groups at the beginning of the school term and how we had to work with our group to collect points to gain a prize at the end of the term. In this case, my teacher used games and competition as an incentive to work hard and remember what we were learning in class. On the other hand, I have had many classes that have been readings and homework and just getting the work done; in other words, not much fun was included. There are many ways of learning and the same could be said about playing a game; there can be many ways to play a game.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am taking two HIST courses this term, and both happen to be taught in different ways and yet both help me learn. I know that when my parents were in school, they did not have the same experiences that my sisters and I had. In this case, I find it interesting to see the development of teaching and how it still has the same goal; getting a student to learn new information.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the first interlude period, I had done my reflection through Twine but this time I wanted to try Mural. I wanted to see how this platform can allow me to express my thoughts and if it will be useful for my unessay. At this moment,  I am thinking that Mural might not be the platform that I will use based on my ideas for my unessay (Unessay Section Below). However, I do like how Mural allows me to express my thoughts as is it were a virtual essay; who knows, maybe I'll be able to use Mural for another course.&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Historical Problem Space (HPS) Framework </h1>
            <h2><p>The HPS framework will be beneficial for my unessay as it will allow to me to look at it from another perspective. I feel that this will help me to plan out what the purpose of my unessay is and how it will function. I like to belive that this framework helps me to gain a general picture of the elements behind a game. It allows a creator to analyze what is included in their games and see how all the elements work together to create the aesthetic of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I like how the HPS helps to plan everything out. I feel that if a game creator uses this it allows them to see their game not only as that but in a way, as a method of teaching. In a historical context, I feel that it allows both the player and creator to look at the general context of a historical event and then realize the contents of the event. The HPS framework allows someone to realize why a historical event happened, they can analyze the people in the event as well as what happened and how this influenced other events.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a historical context, I feel that it allows people to gain a further understanding of a situation and what happened. However, I do think that there would be some changes. I think that in a historical context it wouldn't be a "gameworld" but maybe more like a setting or place and instead of agents it would be something more like who was involved. In any way, I think that it helps to further study a historical event.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, in class, even though we collectively tried to fill out this framework for the game <span style="color: rgb(44,130,201);">Nothing Besides Remains</span>, we came up with many different answers. This stood out to me. It made me realize that no matter how a game is produced, everyone will have their own personal opinion or view on it. The same can be said about a historical moment. While some historians may think that X happened at Z time, others may disagree and think that X happened at B time. And yet, that's what makes this framework fun.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Up until this point in the course, there were moments and conversations that made me think about my unessay. There were a couple moments thoroughout the term when a "western point of view" was mentioned when it comes to video games and "who" they supposed to be meant for or what they are portrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I enjoyed Atuel for many reasons. I only played for a few minutes and did not finish the entire game. however, it was so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing that I have not been able to forget about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think that what stuck out to me the most was listening to people explain what the river means to them. Because I understand and speak spanish, I know that I had a different experience in comparison to someone who doesn't speak spanish. Although I myself am not from Argentina, I felt a sense of pride from seeing such a beautiful game being about South American culture; this led me to think that I wanted to do the same thing. Why should I not make my unessay about something related to my Colombian culture?</p>

            <p>While Atuel was where I started to think about my unessay, I had some conversations with my mom that helped me to further my ideas. I sat down with my mom one day and asked her the most open question I could, "mom, what do you think is interesting part of Colombian history?" and boy oh boy did she give me a look. My mom explained to me that Colombia, just like many other countries in the world, is full of rich history that many people do not even know.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I later had a conversation with J.T telling him how I was thinking about making my assignment about something related to Colombian history. We both started talking about how interesting it would be to do something that isn't related to western culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Like I mentioned before, I am taking another HIST course this term and it is about Indigenous people and Canada. I've heard my mom mention the Indigenous people of Colombia every now and then but still not too often. And then it came to me. I had gone to Colombia in May and with some family friends I went to Guatavita. We went on a walk through the man made trails around the lake with a tour guide. What stood out to me was that the tour guide was actually part of the Indigenous community that resided in the area. He told the group about history of Guatavita and why it looks the way it does today. I'll include some pictures of what it looked like when I went in May below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The guide explained the history of Guatavita while we climed to the top of the lake. When we reached the very top, he told us that lake used be full to the very top of where we were standing. He mentioned that there was a legend of gold and riches to be found at the bottom of the lake and sadly, the Spaniards who were in Colombia around the 1500s wanted to find the gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the second picture above, you can see where the Spanish started digging in attempt to drain the lake in order to lower the water level. From what I remember from what the guide told us, the Spanish found some gold but not as much as they were expecting. However, they started to see how this was affecting the environment of the forest and thankfully stopped digging. Sadly, the water level of the lake dropped drastically but the legend of gold at the bottom remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, I went a few months ago, I do not remember all the details teh guide told us. I wanted to take this opportunity to not only learn more about my culture but also to be able to share part of Colombia's history with others as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what format will my unessay be? I was thinking of a simulation game, possibly usuing Twine. I was thinking of making a game where you go back in time and become a Spaniard who is looking for gold. You converse with other Spaniards who discuss the plans of draining the lake in search for gold. But before that you are in the point of view of one of the Muisca people hearing about the legend of the lake at a gathering as this will provide context of the game. Overall, I was thinking the game go back and forth between the Spanish and Muisca POV to express what was going on during this time. I was thinking that towrds the end of the game, the player would go forward in time as of they are taking the same tour that I did and are hearing about the modern day thoughts about what happened at Lake Guatavita in the 1500s.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess we'll have to wait and see how this will turn out...</p>
